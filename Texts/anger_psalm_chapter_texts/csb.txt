 Answer me when I call, God of my righteousness.
You freed me from affliction; be gracious to me and hear my prayer.
How long, O people, will you be arrogant?
How long will you love what is worthless and pursue a lie?
Know that the Lord has set apart the faithful for himself;
the Lord will hear when I call to him.
Be angry and do not sin;
on your bed, reflect in your heart and be still.
Offer sacrifices in righteousness
and trust in the Lord.
Many are asking, “Who can show us anything good?”
Let the light of your face shine on us, Lord.
You have put gladness in my heart
more than when their grain and new wine abound.
I will both lie down and sleep in peace,
for you alone, Lord, make me live in safety.
