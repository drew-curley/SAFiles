The Lord declares to my Lord:
“Sit at my right hand
until I make your enemies your footstool.”
The Lord will extend your mighty scepter from Zion.
Rule over your surrounding enemies.
Your people will volunteer on your day of battle.
In holy splendor, from the womb of the dawn,
the dew belongs to you.
The Lord has sworn an oath and will not take it back:
“You are a priest forever
according to the pattern of Melchizedek.”
The Lord is at your right hand;
he will crush kings on the day of his anger.
He will judge the nations, heaping up corpses;
he will crush leaders over the entire world.
He will drink from the brook by the road;
therefore, he will lift up his head.
