When the Lord restored the fortunes of Zion, we were like those who dream. Our mouths were filled with laughter, and our tongues with shouts of joy. Then they said among the nations, “The Lord has done great things for them.” The Lord has done great things for us; we were joyful. Restore our fortunes, Lord, like streams in the Negev. Those who sow in tears will reap with shouts of joy. Though one goes along weeping, carrying the bag of seed, he will surely come back with shouts of joy, carrying his sheaves.
