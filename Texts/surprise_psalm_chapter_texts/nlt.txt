When the Lord restored his fortunes for Zion, we were like those who dream. Our mouths were filled with laughter, and our tongues with shouts of joy. Then it was said among the nations, “The Lord has done great things for them.” Yes, the Lord has done great things for us, and we are filled with joy. Restore our fortunes, Lord, as streams renew the desert. Those who plant in tears will harvest with shouts of joy. They weep as they go to plant their seed, but they sing as they return with the harvest.
